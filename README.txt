Description: In this file I have implemented backpropagation, a technique used to optimize neural networks.

What I learned:

Python:
- It is possible to perform operations on objects by creating methods such as "__add__" and "__mul__".
- Graphviz is a Python library that is used to visualize graphs. 

Math:
- AP Calculus concepts, specifically derivatives and the chain rule, are at the heart of backpropagation. As someone who is currently taking an AP Calculus course, it was amazing to see real world applications of the content I have been studying!
