Description: In this file I have implemented backpropagation, a technique used to optimize neural networks.

What I learned:

Python:
- It is possible to perform operations on objects by creating methods such as "__add__" and "__mul__".
- Graphviz is a Python library that is used to visualize graphs. 

Math:
- AP Calculus concepts, specifically derivatives and the chain rule, are at the heart of backpropagation. As someone who took an AP Calculus course, it's amazing to see real world applications of the content I have studied!
- The hyperbolic function tanh is used as an activation function in a neural network.

AI:
- A neural network is simply a complex mathematical function.
- A neuron in a neural network contains a set of weights for each input it receives, a bias value, and an activation function.
